**AmirahCasey/AmirahCasey** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. 
- I am a second year graduate student at the University of Washington School of Aquatic and Fishery Science. I am also in the Future Rivers program (https://futurerivers.uw.edu/) and the lesson planning co-lead of Students Explore Aquatic Science (SEAS, https://fish.uw.edu/students/student-organizations/students-explore-aquatic-sciences-seas/). I am broadly interested in how changes in climate and land use will affect marine and freshwater environments. In a collaboration with NOAA studying the interactions of multiple stressors, I aim to identify priority areas to mitigate contaminant and thermal stress on Coho salmon in Puget Sound.
