- How to reach me: acasey2@uw.edu
 
- I am a graduate student at the University of Washington School of Aquatic and Fishery Science. I am also in the Future Rivers program and the lesson planning co-lead of Students Explore Aquatic Science (SEAS, https://fish.uw.edu/students/student-organizations/students-explore-aquatic-sciences-seas/). In a collaboration with NOAA, I am studying the interactions of multiple stressors such as contamiant and themral stress, and identifying priority areas to mitigate these impacts on salmon.
